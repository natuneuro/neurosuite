 *  @short A base class for a model used by QPageView.

 *  implement custom models for QPageView. Additional to the standard
 *  Qt::ItemDataRoles it provides the two roles
 *
 *    @li HeaderRole
 *    @li WidgetRole
 *
 *  which are used to return a header string for a page and a QWidget
 *  pointer to the page itself.

 *  \code
 *    QPageView *view = new QPageView( this );
 *    QPageModel *model = new MyPageModel( this );
 *
 *    view->setModel( model );
